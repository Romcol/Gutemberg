          <p>This project is a part of the Computer Science department 4th year training course of INSA Rennes and proposed by the Intuidoc team of Irisa. Its aim is to improve the access to local and old press archives. So, our project concerns the provision of old press documents using an accessible to all platform. This is from a prototype, which is conceived by the Intuidoc team, we're developing this platform. This prototype allows to read into old newspapers images (19th and 20th centuries) to generate a structured representation of each page content. Moreover, Yoann Royer, a Sopra-Steria project manager and an INSA former graduate has been offering his support and advice during the project. </p> 
          <h3 style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">The access to the old documents in the digital age is a real problem</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:20px">Several millions of newspaper being dated from the French revolution until today are currently in the archives. In general, the archives documents access is improvable.
          Indeed, this access is restricted for document conservation reasons. Moreover, some archives contain mileages of shelves and, even if this number is lower for old press, the access to documents which are about a precise topic is complicated. However, the digitization doesn't resolve totally the access problem. That needs also to make these documents accessible online with ergonomic tools.</p>
